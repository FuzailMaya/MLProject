Heart Disease Prediction Modeling

To address the task of predicting heart disease, I developed a machine learning model using logistic regression in Python. This supervised learning model classifies instances into two categories: presence or absence of heart disease. I employed a vectorized implementation utilizing the NumPy library for efficient parallel computation, resulting in significantly faster execution compared to traditional looping methods. The dataset utilized for training was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Heart Disease dataset. I partitioned the data into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split, enabling evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. The model achieved an impressive 91% accuracy in distinguishing instances of heart disease from non-cases when tested on unseen data.
